Details in the playGame.py file on how to play the game.

Highly recommend using Anaconda Python 3.5 distribution. It should come with (and configure) everything you need to run this project.

Download Anaconda here:

https://www.anaconda.com/download/


In the Anaconda command prompt (program is called Anaconda Prompt) type "conda install python=3.5" to downgrade to Python 3.5

To run Python using Anaconda, start the program called Anaconda Navigator (might take a minute to actually launch) and select an IDE. Then open the Python program and run it.

Libraries needed:
Theano 1.x
Pandas
